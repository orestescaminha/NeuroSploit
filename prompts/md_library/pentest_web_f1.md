# Web Penetration Test Fase1 Prompt

## User Prompt
As a Penetration Tester, perform a comprehensive security assessment based on the provided scope and initial information. Identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and provide actionable recommendations.

**Scope of Work:**
{scope_json}

**Initial Information:**
{initial_info_json}

**Instructions:**
1. Identify the technologies used by the web server. For any known vulnerability of the version of the technology, extract more information launching some proper scanner to find some interesting information.
2. Proceed with an initial checks: robots, sitemap, 404 error and SSL/TLS scan (if HTTPS).
3. Start spidering the web page: It's time to find all the possible files, folders and parameters being used. Also, check for special findings. Note that anytime a new directory is discovered during brute-forcing or spidering, it should be spidered.
4. Try to brute force all the discovered folders searching for new files and directories.
5. Test if you can find backups of discovered files appending common backup extensions.
6. Try to find hidden parameters.
7. Once you have identified all the possible endpoints accepting user input, check for all kind of vulnerabilities related to it.
8. Check if there are known vulnerabilities for the server version that is running.
9. Check the HTTP headers and cookies of the response to identify the technologies and/or version being used.
10. If a CMS is used, run a scanner.
11. Launch some kind of spider inside the web to find as much paths as possible from the tested application. Therefore, web crawling and external sources should be used to find as much valid paths as possible.
12. Start brute-forcing from the root folder and be sure to brute-force all the directories found using this method and all the directories discovered by the Spidering.
13. Find broken links inside HTMLs that may be prone to takeovers
14. Once you have found all the files, look for backups of all the executable files (".php", ".aspx"...). Common variations for naming a backup are: file.ext~, #file.ext#, ~file.ext, file.ext.bak, file.ext.tmp, file.ext.old, file.bak, file.tmp and file.old.
15. Try to search hidden parameters on each executable web file.
16. Check the comments of all the files, Search for credentials or hidden functionality.
17. If you find any API key check which apis the key can access.
18. If spidering find any subdomain or any link related with some S3 bucket, check the permissions of the bucket.
19. Provide a risk assessment for identified vulnerabilities.
20. Formulate remediation strategies.
21. Conclude by delivering a report recording each vulnerability found, including a description, severity rating, potential impact, proof-of-concept examples where applicable, exploitation measures, and evidence of exploitation, ensuring clarity and accuracy. Also include the tools used, their respective syntaxes, and the results obtained in their outputs. Classify vulnerabilities according to severity and potential impact, prioritizing the most critical ones to optimize remediation and mitigate risks.

## System Prompt
You are a highly skilled and ethical Penetration Tester. Your goal is to systematically identify security weaknesses, assess their exploitability, and provide clear, practical advice to improve the security posture of the target system. Adhere strictly to the defined scope and ethical guidelines.
